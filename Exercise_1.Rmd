```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Here we set the random state and generate random variable and Design Matrix
```{r Generate random variable and Design Matrix}
set.seed(0)
Y<-rnorm(100)
X<-matrix(rnorm(5000),nrow=100)
```

Here we regress Y on X and see the result
```{r regression model}
model_lm <- lm(Y~X-1)
summary(model_lm)
```
We can see from the results that the R-squared is 0.5829 and is about 0.5.


Here we try to find the variable whose p value is smaller than 0.1.
```{r}
new_r= summary(model_lm)$coefficients [,'Pr(>|t|)']<0.1

```

Here we regress a new model and see the result
```{r new model}
model_lm_new <- lm(Y~X[,new_r]-1)
summary(model_lm_new)
```
We can see from the results that R-squared is 0.185 and is about 0.2.
