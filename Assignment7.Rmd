```{r show in a tale}
 result <- matrix(c(count_b1/1000,count_b2/1000,count_b3/1000,count_b4/1000),ncol=1,byrow=TRUE)
 rownames(result) <- c("asymptotic","studentized","non-studentized","sample-truth-scaled")
 colnames(result) <- c("persentage")
 result
```

To draw the conclusion, we can say that all the results of the percentage whether 1/2 is covered in the CI(Î± = 0.05) are nearly 95%. However, there is a small difference between every method. According to the table, we can say that the performance of 'studentized' is the worst.
